# EveryDay
This app aims at helping people to achieve their goal of practicing whatever they want (meditation was the first focus, but loads of other things need regular practice too : playing an instrument, juggling, reading, drawing, or even doing sports!) on a daily basis.
There are three steps to empower the user :
  -reminding her to practice daily and logging sessions
  -giving her an exhaustive access to the sessions log datas, and giving some pre-analysis to help identify her personnal weaknesses
  -motivating her with a gamification concept
